-> Ideas, what to avoid, what has the potential, what do you think we should include?


done: 
- draw 8 planets, the universe, and sun and moon of each planets, blending the texture on its
- draw  orbits for each planet
- making each planet move around the sun and rotation of itself , the moons goes around the planet according to it real life physic (scale down the ratio)
- have timer speed buttons that change the speed of the world from x1 to x32 times
- have option to focus camera on each planets and sun and display information of each planet(planet name, orbit time, rotate time, AU distance)
- can move the camera from a,w,s,d button to move left,in,back,right 
- ability to see different point of view of the system though holding and moving the mouse
- get shading and ambient on reflecting sun light on each planet  
- have option to show orbits and moons

results:
- the web is running on local host, have 8 planets, sun, moons, the universe create and blending texture
- the orbit is show and  planets run according to its, no planets run anomaly, crashing into other planet nor run off the solar system, the planet rotate around itself
- time speed work and speed up the moving time of the system
- can move the camera from a,w,s,d
- have ambient sun light on each planet, which have day and night
- can show orbits and moons and option to disable the feature 
- can focus camera on each planet but not implement right so expect for mercury when time speed change still focus on the planets but
