Advanced Scaling & Proportion Techniques Implemented:

1. Multi-Tier Adaptive Scaling System
    5-level scale system (Inner System â†’ Galactic View) with smooth transitions
    Logarithmic compression for extreme distances (outer solar system)
    Hierarchical scaling factors that adapt to viewing distance
    Performance-aware scaling that automatically adjusts quality

2. Dynamic Level of Detail (LOD) System
    Performance-based LOD adaptation - monitors frame rate and adjusts quality
    Object importance weighting - key objects (Earth, Sun, Jupiter) get better detail
    Distance-based geometry reduction - from 128 to 8 triangle segments
    Adaptive texture loading - disables textures at extreme distances
    Particle density scaling - reduces asteroid/Kuiper belt particles when needed

3. Real Astronomical Proportions
    Precise planetary sizes (Mercury: 0.383 Earth radii, Jupiter: 11.21 Earth radii)
    Accurate orbital distances with AU-based scaling
    Realistic moon systems with proper size ratios and orbital distances
    Enhanced planetary data including mass, density, albedo, and atmospheric properties
    Axial tilt implementation (Uranus rotates sideways)

4. Advanced Performance Optimization
    Scene recreation system - rebuilds objects with optimal geometry for current scale
    Frustum culling - objects beyond view distance are not rendered
    Memory management - properly disposes of geometries/materials when changing scales
    Auto-quality adjustment - reduces detail if frame rate drops below 30 FPS
    Performance monitoring - tracks frame times and adjusts rendering accordingly

5. Enhanced Particle Systems
    Realistic asteroid belt with size variations and clustering
    Kuiper belt with scattered disk objects - different distributions and colors
    Adaptive particle counts - scales from 50 to 20,000 based on performance
    Improved visual variety - different colors and sizes for different object types

6. Smooth Scale Transitions
    Cubic easing transitions between scale levels
    Interpolated camera movement - smooth zoom between scales
    Progressive quality adjustment during transitions
    UI feedback during scale changes

7. Realistic Orbital Mechanics
    Kepler's 3rd law approximation - outer planets orbit slower
    Elliptical orbits for dwarf planets with proper eccentricity and inclination
    Retrograde moon orbits (like Triton around Neptune)
    Proper rotation periods scaled for visualization

8. Enhanced Visual Features
    Adaptive lighting - light intensity and range scale with viewing distance
    Ring systems for Saturn and Uranus
    Atmospheric effects for gas giants and Venus
    Cloud layers for Earth and Venus
    Specialized materials for different object types
